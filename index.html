                Sports can be defined as physical activities or games that involve skill, physical exertion, and competition. They typically have specific rules or regulations and are often organized into various forms, such as team sports or individual sports. Sports are not only a means of physical exercise but also a source of entertainment, personal development, and social interaction. They can be played at recreational, amateur, or professional levels, and they encompass a wide range of activities, including but not limited to football, basketball, tennis, swimming, golf, running, and many others. The primary purpose of sports is to provide individuals with opportunities for physical fitness, skill development, and the enjoyment of participating in or observing competitive activities.
